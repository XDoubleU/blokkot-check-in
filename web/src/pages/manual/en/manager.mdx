    ## Locations
    <img src="/manual/images/locations-listview.png" width={ImageWidth} />

    In the *Locations* tab you can find all locations with their *ID*.
    The screenshot above contains the location *Het Entrepot* with the *ID* *het-entrepot*.
    New locations can be added using the *Create* button and existing locations can be changed using *Update*.

    ## Schools
    <img src="/manual/images/schools-listview.png" width={ImageWidth} />

    After checking in students have to select their school. This is used for having an easy overview of which students use the locations.
    In the *Schools* tab you can find all schools with their name.
    The screenshot above shows some.
    Schools can be added using *Create* and can be changed using *Update*. Only the 'school' *Andere* can't be updated.

    ## Integration with website
    To show the data from this webapp on your own website you have to couple the capacity using the ID of the location.
    Below there's an example of the window in SquareSpace where this can be changed.
