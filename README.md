This web application allows you to manage check-ins at multiple locations. Users can anonymously check-in by simply pressing a button. The app utilizes a websocket connection to display live location capacity on your website, allowing you to provide up-to-date information to your visitors.

Originally developed for Brugge Studentenstad, a non-profit organization that arranges student activities and manages study locations in Bruges, this app has been used to provide live capacity updates for each location on their website. Additionally, students are asked to select their school, providing Brugge Studentenstad with valuable data insights.
